# Neural Network Architectures (Chronological Order)

## Early CNN Architectures
- [ ] **2012** – AlexNet (Deep CNN that won the ImageNet competition)  
- [ ] **2014** – VGGNet (Deep CNN with 3x3 convolution filters)  
- [ ] **2014** – Network in Network (Used micro neural networks as building blocks)  
- [ ] **2015** – InceptionNet (GoogleNet, used inception modules for multi-scale processing)  

## Advanced Architectures
- [ ] **2015** – ResNet (Residual networks using skip connections)  
- [ ] **2016** – HighwayNet (Uses learned gates to regulate information flow)  
- [ ] **2016** – DenseNet (Dense connections between layers to improve feature reuse)  
- [ ] **2016** – Residual Attention Network (Uses attention mechanisms with residual networks)  
- [ ] **2017** – SENet (Squeeze-and-Excitation network to improve feature recalibration)  
- [ ] **2017** – ResNext (Extension of ResNet with group convolutions)  

## Capsule Networks & Transformers
- [ ] **2017** – Capsule Network (Uses capsules to preserve spatial hierarchies in the data)  
- [ ] **2020** – Vision Transformer (Uses transformer architecture for image classification)
